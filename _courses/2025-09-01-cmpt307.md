graphs

- [MIT 6.042](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB7540DEDD482705B&feature=shared)
    - lecture 1 to 3 are helpful to review "proof by induction".
    - lecture 6 to 11 are related to graph theory. I didn't take MACM101 and/or MACM201 at SFU, so reviewed.
    - lecture 12 and 13 might be helpful to review asymptotics, but better read textbook chapter 2 and [Recitation 1: Asymptotic Complexity, Peak Finding](https://youtu.be/P7frcB_-g4w?feature=shared)
- read required textbook chapter 2 and chapter 3
