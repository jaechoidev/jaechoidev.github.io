Summer was not good on the GPA side. On the bright side, I did 2 mandatory courses that I didn't have interests,
and I am working on a capstone project that helps me dip my toe into the research world.

### Review of 2025 summer
I was fortunate to have these lectures in this semester, and I recommend taking these by following instructors.

#### cmpt 376w - Felix Lo
I might be able to say in detail, but I want to say on this publicly available post.
It's mandatory course, so.. good luck for anyone who didn't take it yet.
On the grading side, attendence could make difference, and start assignments and term projects early.

#### cmpt 353 - Greg Baker
This course is an introduction of data analysis, which contains practicing python libraries to analyze datasets.
This is not about the machine learning specifically, but this course gives some brief understanding on them as well.
Mostly about Pandas and scikit-learn a bit, but more importantly, it's about how to use data.
If you have any interests in data science, this could be a start, 
but in general CS students who think on the path of software engineer, it might not be very interesting or helpful.
cmpt354 might be a better choice? I'm not sure.

#### cmpt 494 - Ke Li
I'm taking this SOSY capstone project with Ke Li. 
This is an implementation of PAPR (Proximity attention point render) into the nerfstudio codebase.
It is a team project with one other team member.

It helped me to imagine about "what the research path or research engineering would look like".
Also, it's only two members, I'm thinking about a way to do this team project better.
Because I thought that the delegation could be done naturally by each of our interests,
but it's a bit unbalanced at last. I have another semester to finish this project, so we'll see..
