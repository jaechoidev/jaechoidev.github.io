Hi, I'm Jae.

I'm a software engineer and pipeline TD with experience in VFX and animation production. I've developed tools for production automation, written shader code, built templates for production requirements, and debugged render farm issues to resolve bottlenecks. My work has spanned lighting, compositing, look development, and review/delivery workflows.

Now I'm expanding into machine learning and AI research. My background in production pipelines gives me a practical perspective on building scalable data workflows and understanding the quality requirements for training generative models. I'm particularly interested in bridging the gap between 3D graphics expertise and AI/ML development, whether that means designing synthetic data generation pipelines, optimizing neural rendering techniques, or bringing production-level quality to large-scale model training.
