I am a computing science undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University. I am interested in machine learning, computer vision, and graphics. I was a lighting-compositing pipeline technical director in VFX and animation industry for about five years and worked on various projects including feature films and episodic series. I am currently looking for research opportunities.
