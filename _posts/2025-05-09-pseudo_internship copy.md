edit: I got an interview chance from capstone project (May 12), so pseudo internship might be combined with the capstone project topic if I could get enroll. Let's see..

I tried to contact some professors for research / project related opportunities, but I didn't get any response for this summer.
I guess I need more records and some projects. So, I found one to customize as my own pseudo internship ;)

### Program overview
This is same length with summer term but no final exam period.
It is around 10 weeks program which covers 3d machine learning (pointnet, nerf) and generative models (diffusion and gan). if time allows, I'd like to try 3dgs code but it's optional. 

Also, I'm planning to build paper reading habit. every week, I'll choose 10 papers, and skim them to one line summaries (like I learned from ECSR workshop!). Then, choose 1 paper to read entirely and post the results.

There are several repos I'm going to use, and maybe I'll take some additional lectures from various sources. Also, I'll find and summary one seminar / talk per week.

In short,
- several lecture sources
- 5 project/ assignments
- 1 paper reading
- 1 seminar/ talk

Let's go!
